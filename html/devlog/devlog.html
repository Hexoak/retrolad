        <p>
          Work on the Basic Platformer has been successful; and you can check it out <a href="../games/basicPlatformer/index2.html">HERE</a><br>
          I created the basic layout and determined the best way to stack the tiles. <br>
          Also - applied some camera tricks.<br>
          It may develop into a larger project, but for now, the functional framework is in the hopper.<br>
          As with Bone collector, I made the tilesets and code available. <br>
          The Framework that I've been using for my projects also should get some article/tutorial in the future<br><br>
          Another piece of art was also posted. There is alot more that I would have liked to have done with it-- <br>
          However, I may use this peice and contunte to develop it further with code as a Media+ item. <br>
          Cheers.<br>

        <p>
          After working on <a href="../games/BoneCollector/index.html">Bone Collector</a>, I decided that for my next Phaser project that I would creat a Devlog.<br>
          This will keep me on track for the changes I make, the items I develop and provide a sequential map of my progress. <br>
          For the next project, I'd like to develop the framework to build a basic platformer.<br>
          After the basics are worked out, I'll begin to develop some art to create the experience.<br>
          <br>
          I started this project out as I normally do- sketching a basic asset and then expanding upon it.<br> 
          This asset was Player9. <br>
          I created the sketch, the idle and a running anim suitable for a side-scrolling profile.<br>
          
          Will still need to develop a number of animations for this project, including<br>
          Jump anim<br>
          Climbing anim<br>
          <br>
          With any project, I tend to keep a txt doc (more recently OneNote) to track the things to do.<br>
          Very much so with the animations and assets for this project.<br>
          There are <em>a lot</em> of them.. It will take some time to work out the art.<br>
          <br>
          Also developing the framework in Phaser. More to come on that.<br>
          As with Bone Collector, the format will be in object orientation<br>
          This project will (as it should) be more robust and complicated than the last.<br>
          Always pushing to the next level.

          <p><b>11.22.2022</b> - Random Pattern Generator <br> <br> 
            A while back I was trying to teach myself and understand the basics of cellular autonoma and random generation for use in my art and potentially games. <br> <br>
            While I am still learning how this all works, in my research late one night I stumbled upon an interesting project <br><br>
            The project was for a university entry-level programming course that a professor posted some years ago as an extra credit assignment for his students. <br><br>
            It involved utilizing HTML Canvas to generate 1-bit random patterns, akin to what you might see in a QR code. <br>
            I realized the potential of this program as a level-generator of sorts, but since there were scaling options as well-- <br>
            I could also see it being used also as a texture tool, among other things. <br><br>
            Some simple modifications of the program would allow for colors to be added instead of the basic two-tone. <br><br>
            While it was not a “step-by-step” or “how-to” style video, I followed along and was able to reverse engineer the project, which I will post here. <br> <br>
            I will also include the source code and files so you may compile your own. <br>
